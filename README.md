# rssboat
- RSS reader inspired by newsboat

## Todo
- [ ] "Latest" should be displayed in feed item description when present
- [ ] "r" should refresh a single feed
- [ ] Feed items should have a view that displays content
- [ ] feeds.yaml should not be relative path
- [ ] State should be stored in JSON
- [ ] "o" should not trigger feed open when filtering

## Refactor
- [ ] Make field test names descriptive

## Future
- [ ] Opening feed items should work on all operating systems with default browser

## Maybe
- [ ] "q" should not quit when in items view, but should go back to feeds view
- [ ] "h" and "l" should open and close feeds
